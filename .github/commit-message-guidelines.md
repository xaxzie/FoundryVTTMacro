# Commit Message Guidelines

To ensure concise and meaningful commit messages, follow these rules:

## Format

1. **Use Imperative Mood**:
   - Start with a verb in the present tense (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update").
   - Example: `Add turn validation to combat macros`

2. **Keep It Short**:
   - Limit the subject line to 50 characters.
   - Use the body for additional details if necessary.

3. **Be Specific**:
   - Clearly describe what the commit changes.
   - Avoid vague terms like "fix stuff" or "update code".

4. **Use Tags for Context**:
   - Prefix the subject line with a tag if applicable (e.g., `docs:`, `feat:`, `fix:`).
   - Example: `docs: Update README with API examples`

## Examples

- `feat: Add turn validation to spell macros`
- `fix: Resolve animation timing bug`
- `docs: Update installation guide for combat integration`
- `refactor: Simplify combat state validation`

## Automation
