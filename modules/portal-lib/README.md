# Portal - Modified Version

A library module for spawning creatures, teleporting tokens, and picking locations. This is a **modified standalone version** of the original Portal module by theripper93.

## âœ¨ New Feature: Shift Key Free Positioning

When using Portal on a gridded scene, you can now hold **Left Shift** to temporarily switch to free-hand positioning, allowing you to place templates and tokens at exact pixel coordinates without grid snapping. Release Shift to return to normal grid snapping behavior.

- **With Grid + No Shift**: Normal grid snapping (as before)
- **With Grid + Shift Held**: Free positioning at exact mouse coordinates
- **No Grid**: Always free positioning (unchanged behavior)

## Modifications Made

This version includes the following changes from the original:

- **Shift Key Free Positioning**: Hold Shift to bypass grid snapping on gridded scenes
- **Enhanced Logging**: Detailed console output for debugging positioning behavior
- **Standalone Version**: Removed git references and build dependencies
