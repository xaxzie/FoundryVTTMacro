### üîö `EndGenericEffect.js`

**Purpose**: Comprehensive template for ending character effects with advanced cleanup.

**Key Features**:

- **Multiple effect mechanics** (simple, linked, bidirectional, counter, transformation)
- **Cascade removal** for complex linked effects
- **Bidirectional cleanup** (target ‚Üî caster effect pairs)
- **Counter management** (decreasing main counters when effects are removed)

- **GM delegation** for effect removal permissions
- **Custom liberation animations** per effect type
- **Comprehensive UI** with effect categorization
- **Detailed feedback** with chat messages and notifications

**Effect Mechanics Supported**:

1. **Simple Effects**: Direct removal
2. **Linked Effects**: 1 effect ‚Üí removes multiple linked effects (cascade)
3. **Bidirectional Effects**: Effect on target ‚Üî corresponding effect on caster
4. **Counter Effects**: Removal decreases main counter on caster
5. **Transformation Effects**: Token Magic FX filter cleanup + reversal animations

**Advanced Cleanup**:

- Sequencer persistent animations by name
- Token Magic FX polymorph/filter removal
- Complex flag-based effect detection
- Multi-target effect management
- Error handling with detailed feedback

**Usage**: Copy to character folder, rename to `end[Character]Effect.js`, and configure EFFECT_CONFIG with character's effects and their specific mechanics.

## üìã Template Usage Guide

### For Character Effect Handlers

1. **Copy HandleGenericEffect.js** to your character folder
2. **Rename** to `Handle[Character]Effect.js`
3. **Configure CHARACTER_CONFIG** with character details
4. **Set up EFFECT_CONFIG** with your character's specific effects
5. **Test and adjust** animations, mana costs, and mechanics

### For End Effect Handlers

1. **Copy EndGenericEffect.js** to your character folder
2. **Rename** to `end[Character]Effect.js`
3. **Configure CHARACTER_CONFIG** with character branding
4. **Set up EFFECT_CONFIG** with effect types and cleanup mechanics
5. **Define mechanicType** for each effect (simple, linked, bidirectional, counter, transformation)
6. **Test cascade removal** and cleanup systems

### Character Integration

Both templates are designed to work together:

- **HandleGenericEffect.js** creates and manages effects
- **EndGenericEffect.js** provides comprehensive cleanup
- **Shared configuration patterns** for consistency
- **Compatible flag systems** for effect detection

## üîß Technical Requirements

- **FoundryVTT v13+**: ActiveEffect system, CONFIG.statusEffects integration
- **Token Magic FX**: Visual effects, transformations, filters
- **Sequencer**: Animations, persistent effects, cleanup
- **GM Socket**: Effect management delegation (via custom-status-effects module)
- **JB2A Assets**: Animation files (recommended)

## üé® Customization

All templates are highly customizable:

- **Visual styling** through CSS classes and colors
- **Animation systems** with custom file paths and configurations
- **UI layouts** with resizable dialogs and organized sections
- **Effect mechanics** through modular configuration systems
- **Chat messaging** with character-specific branding

## üìö Integration with Existing Systems

These templates integrate with:

- **Utility macros** in `../utilities/` folder
- **Asset management** systems for animations and sounds
- **Character stat systems** for damage and effect calculations
- **Status effect management** through CONFIG integration
- **Permission systems** via GM delegation

## üöÄ Installation and Setup

1. **Generic macros** (roll-characteristic, complete-spell-template) can be used directly
2. **Template files** should be copied and customized per character
3. **Dependencies** should be installed and configured
4. **Asset paths** should be verified for animations and effects
5. **Test thoroughly** with your specific character configurations

## ü§ù Contributing

When adding new generic macros or improving templates:

1. **Ensure compatibility** with all character types
2. **Use existing utility functions** for consistency
3. **Include comprehensive error handling** and user feedback
4. **Document all configuration options** and mechanics
5. **Test with multiple characters** and edge cases
6. **Update this README** with new features and macros
7. **Follow established patterns** for UI, animations, and chat integration

## üìñ Documentation

- Inline documentation in all template files
- Configuration examples within each template
- Error handling guides and debugging information
- Integration examples with existing character systems
